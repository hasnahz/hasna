Objective: Deploy a simple static website using GitHub Pages. By the end of this exercise, you will have a live website accessible on the internet.

Instructions:

Prepare your basic HTML and CSS files for deployment.
Use GitHub Pages to host your project online.
Verify your website is accessible via the provided GitHub Pages URL.
Steps:

Step 1: Setting Up Your Project
Rename your HTML file to index.html.
Place all files (HTML, CSS) in a single folder.
Step 2: Creating a GitHub Repository
If you donâ€™t have a GitHub account, create one at GitHub.
Log in to GitHub and create a new repository by clicking the New button.
Name the repository (e.g., my-static-website) and choose the Public option.
Initialize the repository with a README file if you wish, but do not add any .gitignore or license files.
Step 3: Uploading Files
Once your repository is created, click Add file > Upload files to add your HTML, CSS, and any additional files to the repository.
Commit the changes by clicking Commit changes after uploading your files.
Step 4: Activating GitHub Pages
Go to the Settings tab of your repository.
Scroll down to the Pages section.
Under Source, select the branch that contains your index.html file (usually main or master).
GitHub will automatically generate a URL for your website, which will be accessible at https://username.github.io/repository-name (replace username with your GitHub username and repository-name with your repository name).
